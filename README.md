===============

The LAMA 2011 planner is built on the Fast Downward planning system and uses the PDDL format. It was used as baseline planner in the International Planning Competition (IPC) 2018. The planner was created by Silvia Richter (NICTA) and Matthias Westphal (Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg).

The official source of the planner (as presented in IPC 2018) can be found [on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ipc2018-classical/explicit-baseline-planners/src/ipc-2018-seq-sat/). The version that is downloaded by this package is the [official 19.06 release](http://www.fast-downward.org/Releases/19.06).

This package downloads, unzips, and builds the files found there. The planner is then ready for use.

The planner does not require any particular dependencies that are not included in the repository.debs script.
